# 🍕 Pizza Ordering Chatbot (NLP Project)

## 📌 Project Description
This is a simple **NLP-based Pizza Ordering Chatbot** developed as a **self-learning project** to practice conversational AI concepts and chatbot development.

The chatbot allows users to order pizzas using natural language conversations.  
It uses **Dialogflow** for intent detection and entity extraction, **Python with FastAPI** for backend processing, and a small **HTML & CSS frontend** for user interaction.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **Dialogflow ES** – NLP and chatbot platform  
- **Python** – backend logic  
- **FastAPI** – webhook and API handling  
- **MySQL** – database for pizza menu data  
- **HTML & CSS** – simple frontend UI

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User interacts with the chatbot on the website  
2. Dialogflow processes the user input  
3. Dialogflow sends data to the FastAPI webhook  
4. Backend processes the request and queries the database  
5. Response is sent back to the user
